  Hello {name}, This is meant to represent what we can do with this
  Everything comes down to what you want to write {name} and be able to change.
  Today we can show required variables {age}, and the defaulted ones like {unset}
  Here are the reasons this is great:
  {reasons}
variables:
  - key: name
    path: name
    default: Nameless
    formatter:
      cls: DefaultFormatter
  - key: age
  - key: unset
    default: NOT SET
  - key: reasons
    formatter:
      cls: ListFormatter
      args: 
        - "\n"
